I've included the need installers in the repository, assuming the version hasn't changed it should be cocos2d-x 3.5 and cocos for windows on this page though.

Once those are installed to default locations, you can create a project skeleton for a new game, I ve already created one and put it in the repo though.

Create project skeleton:
http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/How_to_Start_A_New_Cocos2D-X_Game#For-Win32-Users
 cocos.py new YourGameTitle -p com.yourcompany.gametitle -l cpp -d C:\YourGameTitle

To get a copy of the latest game files, download github for windows

I have everyone but Mike Dahl as a member of our repo on github. I ve added the rest of your accounts to our repo as members. I believe the repository just appears when you log in? Text me if not, we'll figure it out. Then when you have a local copy of the repository, open it in visual studio and try running it.

If you run into an error loading the project or an error loading from memory during debug, let me know, I've been through these two errors already and understand them.
